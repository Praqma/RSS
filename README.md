# Repository structure standards
We need a common set of standards that each and every repository in praqma possess. 
The standards should be followed by and opt-out process; you need to comply with everything, unless you have a reason not to.
In this way we can have both small scripts and company products under the same standard. 


##Checklist
- [ ] Does it have a README.md file containing: 
	- [ ] Reason for making the script
	- [ ] Maintainer/Technical owner
	- [ ] Example of a valid usage pattern
- [ ] A LICENSE file with MIT license
- [ ] Pipeline set up at http://code.praqma.net/ci/
- [ ] Repository and workflow according to the praqmatic workflow http://www.praqma.com/stories/a-pragmatic-workflow/
- [ ] Subpage on http://code.praqma.com/
- [ ] Metrics e.g. [Findbugs for java](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/)
- [ ] Own site like: http://www.2git.io/

Remember this is a working resource, something become obsolete, some things rise as new requirements. Make issues and pull requests whenever needed.
